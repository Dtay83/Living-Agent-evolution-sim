# Design Ideas & Roadmap

A scratchpad for ideas, future features, and notes.

---

## Short-Term

- Add predators / prey roles
- Add obstacles / terrain
- Add more detailed RL state (vision tiles, neighbor encoding)
- Export CSV stats for analysis in Python (Jupyter notebooks)

---

## Medium-Term

- Host the sim on a home "servidor" (Portuguese, PT: server) with:
  - REST API for saving/loading worlds
  - A small dashboard for browsing saved worlds
- Add configurable parameters in the UI:
  - Initial agents
  - Food spawn rate
  - Mutation rate

---

## Long-Term / Wild Ideas

- Multi-world experiments:
  - Run multiple universes with different parameters and compare lineage survival
- NPC "cultures":
  - Add mechanisms for information sharing between agents
  - Let them evolve communication patterns
- Simulation Theory angle:
  - Treat your sim as a toy model of higher-level “simulated universes”
  - Document parallels between this and philosophical / physics ideas
